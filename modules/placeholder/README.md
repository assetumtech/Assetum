# Placeholder Modules

This folder contains stubs and planning blueprints for core Assetum smart contracts.

These are not functional contracts yet — they represent the initial logic and structure of the capital deployment engine.

## Modules
- capital-router.sol — routing logic across jurisdictions
- compliance-engine.md — compliance filters and access logic (non-code planning)

More modules to come as architecture evolves.
