# Current Status

Assetum is in early-stage infrastructure farming.

We are actively mapping the architecture of real-world capital deployment — across legal jurisdictions, regulatory logic, and AI-native compliance systems.

## What this repository represents:
- Early infrastructure blueprints
- Planned modular smart contract structure
- Governance logic in design phase
- Compliance architecture under simulation

## What this is NOT:
- A fully deployed protocol
- Production-ready smart contracts
- Finalized compliance engine

We’re building in the open — not to signal hype, but to expose architecture.

Follow the progress. Fork the vision.
