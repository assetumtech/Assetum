# Assetum Architecture

---

## Overview  
Assetum is designed as a modular infrastructure layer purpose-built for the AI RWA economy. It provides the foundation for secure, composable, and intelligent interactions with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) â€” enabling both human and AI actors to operate within a unified, verifiable framework.

The protocol architecture consists of distinct, interoperable modules that handle asset registration, orchestration, compliance, and automation.

## Core Components

### 1. Asset Registry  
A permissioned, on-chain registry that maintains metadata, ownership, legal claims, and risk parameters of tokenized RWAs.  
- Supports multiple token standards
- Includes verification mechanisms for off-chain documentation  
- Integrates with external data providers (oracles, legal nodes, auditors)

### 2. Orchestration Engine  
Middleware layer enabling AI agents, smart contracts, and institutions to coordinate value flows and asset interactions.  
- Policy-based automation framework (triggered by events, agents, or governance)  
- Native support for AI-agent interactions (read/write permissions, API hooks)  
- Enforces compliance logic, asset flow restrictions, and business logic

### 3. Compliance Layer  
Customizable module for managing KYC/KYB, jurisdictional access, and real-world legal enforcement.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Identity integrations (DIDs, zero-knowledge attestations)  
- Jurisdiction-aware execution and asset blocking

### 4. Autonomous Vaults  
On-chain asset management containers controlled by smart contracts or AI agents.  
- Configurable by institutions, DAOs, or automated agents  
- Enables strategy execution, yield optimization, or collateralization  
- Can interact with other protocols and marketplaces permissionlessly

### 5. Data & Oracle Integrations  
Real-time price feeds, asset metadata, credit risk scores, and verification data.  
- Built-in support for Chainlink, Pyth, and custom data sources  
- Integration with external AI models for risk analysis or decision-making  
- Supports both push and pull data models

---

## Interoperability  
Assetum is designed to be chain-agnostic and highly composable.  
- Cross-chain messaging support (LayerZero, Wormhole, CCIP)  
- Integration-ready with DeFi, custody, and compliance protocols  
- Deployable on both public and permissioned blockchains

---

## AI Integration  
Unlike legacy protocols, Assetum is natively compatible with AI agents:  
- Standardized interfaces for autonomous agents to read/write on-chain  
- Event triggers and permission systems to guide autonomous execution  
- Supports decentralized AI coordination and agent-to-agent interactions

---

## Security & Governance  
- Modular permissioning and governance framework  
- Supports DAO and institutional governance models  
- Designed with upgradability, auditability, and risk segmentation in mind

---

## Deployment Flexibility  
Assetum can be deployed as:  
- A standalone protocol on public L1/L2s  
- An embedded infrastructure layer within private or enterprise chains  
- A permissioned, enterprise-grade deployment for regulated markets

---

## Summary  
Assetum's architecture reflects its core mission: to power a secure, intelligent, and composable financial system for the AI + RWA era. By bridging institutional requirements with decentralized infrastructure and AI automation, Assetum becomes a foundational layer for the next generation of on-chain economies.
