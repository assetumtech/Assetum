# Security — Assetum

---

## Overview  
Security is a first-class priority in Assetum’s development lifecycle. As infrastructure powering real-world financial assets and AI-driven automation, we enforce rigorous standards across protocol design, implementation, and governance.

This document outlines our current security approach, risk assumptions, and operational principles.

---

## Security Philosophy  
- Minimize trust assumptions: Favor on-chain verifiability and modular risk boundaries  
- Proactive threat modeling: Design for adversarial environments by default  
- Transparent & auditable: Open-source codebases and formal verification (where applicable)  
- Secure-by-default: Permissioning, access control, and automation safety checks are built-in, not bolted on  
- Continuous hardening: Security is never “done” — we improve iteratively with each deployment

---

## Threat Model  
We actively consider and defend against:  
- Smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, misconfigurations)  
- Oracle manipulation and data integrity attacks  
- AI-agent misbehavior (malicious instructions, unauthorized execution)  
- Cross-chain messaging exploits (relayer spoofing, message replay)  
- Compliance circumvention (unauthorized access to restricted assets)

---

## Development Process  
- Peer-reviewed code with multi-step internal QA  
- Formal specification of core modules (registry, orchestration, vault logic)  
- Integration and fuzz testing in simulated AI + RWA environments  
- Secure dependency management and static analysis tools

---

## Bug Bounty  
A formal bug bounty program will be launched post-testnet via a recognized platform.  
We encourage responsible disclosure and offer rewards for valid vulnerabilities.  
To report a vulnerability, contact: security@assetum.tech

---

## Open-Source Commitment  
Assetum will progressively open-source all core modules and interfaces.
