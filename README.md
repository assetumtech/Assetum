# Assetum  
Core infrastructure powering the AI RWA economy

---

## Overview  
Assetum is a foundational protocol designed to support the emerging intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world assets. Built with scalability, composability, and security in mind, Assetum enables the creation and orchestration of AI-integrated financial primitives across decentralized markets.

By providing core infrastructure and seamless integration layers, Assetum bridges traditional asset classes with AI-native applications â€” unlocking new layers of liquidity, intelligence, and utility.

## Key Features  
- AI-Ready Architecture  
  Modular, scalable design optimized for AI-agent interaction, data ingestion, and real-world automation.

- RWA-Native Infrastructure  
  Natively supports tokenized real-world assets (RWA), enabling on-chain access, management, and settlement of physical and financial assets.

- Secure Orchestration Layer  
  Built-in permission layers and governance tooling for institutions, DAOs, and AI systems to safely coordinate value flows.

- Composability at the Core  
  Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing DeFi, oracle networks, and cross-chain messaging protocols.

- Enterprise-Grade Design  
  Infrastructure tailored for scalability, compliance, and modular deployment across public and private chains.

## Use Cases  
- AI-powered asset tokenization platforms  
- RWA-backed stablecoins and lending markets  
- Institutional-grade settlement infrastructure  
- AI agents with autonomous asset management capabilities  
- Enterprise integrations with off-chain asset registries

---

## Status  
Assetum is currently under active development, with core modules being tested across simulated environments. Integration pathways with existing oracle providers, decentralized identity layers, and RWA token standards are in progress.
