# FAQ — Assetum

---

### What is Assetum?  
Assetum is a core infrastructure protocol designed for the AI + RWA economy. It enables AI agents, institutions, and decentralized applications to securely interact with tokenized real-world assets on-chain.

---

### What makes Assetum different from other RWA protocols?  
Unlike general-purpose tokenization layers, Assetum is AI-native by design.  
- Built for autonomous execution  
- Modular compliance architecture  
- Institutional-grade orchestration  
- Designed for both public and permissioned deployments

We don't just bring assets on-chain — we enable them to be governed and utilized intelligently.

---

### Is Assetum only for AI use cases?  
No. While built to be AI-compatible, Assetum is modular and fully usable by human actors — institutions, protocols, and developers — with or without AI integrations.  
But our architecture gives intelligent agents first-class status, not afterthought treatment.

---

### Will Assetum have a native token?  
Assetum is designed with a native coordination layer in mind. While no public token is launched at this stage, governance and economic alignment mechanisms are integral to our long-term roadmap.  
More information will be shared progressively.

---

### Who can build on Assetum?  
Anyone — developers, institutions, startups, DAOs.  
We provide SDKs, templates, and compliance modules to accelerate use cases in tokenization, AI automation, asset management, and cross-chain orchestration.

---

### Is Assetum audited?  
Security is a core priority. Audits are planned with top-tier firms as part of the mainnet readiness process.  
Ongoing testing, formal verification (where relevant), and open-source reviews are part of our dev process.

---

### Can I integrate my protocol or RWA platform with Assetum?  
Yes. We are actively onboarding partners across RWA issuers, oracle networks, DeFi protocols, and AI frameworks.
